# Interactive Spectra Plotting Tool (ISPT)
This tool is created to help analyse and plot 1D spectra. Utilities for this tool (will) include the ability to edit and view the spectra data in many different ways. It also includes tools to fit a multitude of different functions using the lmfit library and some custom made default functions. (Hopefully) You can even create a custom function that it will attempt to create.

## Current Features:
- Importing a file (containing a certain data-structure) and plotting the data
- Saving the figure in the program directory
- Saving the figure with a specific name to a specific folder

- Zoom tool to zoom into a custom area
- Smooth tool that smoothes the data using a smoothing parameter
- Cut tool to cut out a piece of data
- Normalize tools to normalize both the complete dataset, or a specific subset of the data

- Fit tool that can fit three different functions:
  - Linear line fit
  - Polynomial line fit with user-specified degree of freedom/number of variables
  - Exponential fit
  - Powerlaw fit
  - Sine fit
  - Gaussian fit with user-specified number of peaks
  - Exponential Gaussian fit (TBD)
  - Lorentzian fit (TBD)
  - Harmonic Oscillator fit (TBD)
  - Lognormal fit (TBD)
  
- Grid formatting option
- Setting figure to a tight window layout
- Setting x-axis limits
- Setting y-axis limits
- Setting axis labels

- Documentation open button
- Contact information for specific issues, questions or help


## Planned Features:
  - Much more fit functions and profiles (including custom fit functions!)
  - More editing and formatting options
  - Options from user requests
