# Interactive Plotting Tool
This tool is created to help plot and create fits for data that has x and y values. Utilities for this tool (will) include the ability to edit and view the data in many different ways. It also includes tools to fit a multitude of different functions using the lmfit library and some custom made default functions.

## Current Features:
- Importing a file (containing a certain data-structure) and plotting the data
- Saving the figure in the program directory
- Saving the figure with a specific name to a specific folder

- Zoom tool to zoom into a custom area
- Smooth tool that smoothes the data using a smoothing parameter
- Cut tool to cut out a piece of data
- Normalize tools to normalize both the complete dataset, or a specific subset of the data

- Fit tool that can fit different functions:
  - Linear line fit
  - Polynomial line fit with user-specified degree of freedom/number of variables
  - Exponential fit
  - Powerlaw fit
  - Sine fit
  - Gaussian fit with user-specified number of peaks
  - Exponential Gaussian fit (TBD)
  - Lorentzian fit (TBD)
  - Harmonic Oscillator fit (TBD)
  - Lognormal fit (TBD)
  
  - Calculate the Equivalent Width of a line
  It can save both the fit report as a user-readable file, but also the fit itself, so you can always load up the fit if you need a new figure.
 
- Grid formatting option
- Setting figure to a tight window layout
- Setting x-axis limits
- Setting y-axis limits
- Setting axis labels

- Documentation open button (TBH)
- Contact information for specific issues, questions or help (TBD)


## Planned Features:
  - Much more fit functions and profiles (including custom fit functions!)
  - More editing and formatting options
  - Options from user requests
